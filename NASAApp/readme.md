The NASAApp uses the Alamofire 4.8 Framework. Since everything is included with the project, no additional installation is required for tested the app.

To open the project, please open the NASAApp.xcworkspace file (instead of the .xcodeproj file).

The Alamofire site can be found at: https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire

For the NASA API, the project uses my own NASA API Key.

Enjoy ;-)
