import UIKit

// App performance testing
//
// The amount of used memroy has been monitored trough Instruments. During the initial tests it appeared that the amount of memory used was only growing
// when using the Mars Rover Postcard (going back and forth) reaching 500 Mb and more.
// This behavior was due to a cumulative use of the CollectionView data source. The bug is now fixed.
//
// Network throttle has also been tested using Network Link Conditioner. This led to the use of an Activity Indicator for each cell of the CollectionView.
// Initially, only one main Activity Indicator was used.
